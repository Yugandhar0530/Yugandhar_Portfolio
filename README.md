## Projects
### [A Comparative Analysis of Text and Speech Modalities for Emotion Detection: Leveraging ML, DL, and Fine-Tuned LLMs and LAMs](https://github.com/Swaijit-Singh/RI-Emotion-Detection/tree/main)
- Investigated emotion detection in Indian university students (ages 18–25) using machine learning, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for text and speech data across six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise)
- LLMs (e.g., Bert base) outperformed for text analysis (F1-score: 0.7528), while Large Audio Models (e.g., facebook/data2vec-audio-base) showed limited performance for speech (F1-score: 0.2824).
- Combined text and speech data with first- and second-person perspectives, validated through third-person human benchmarking (F1-scores: 0.748 for text, 0.789 for speech).
- Integrated the best-performing LLM (text) and LAM (speech) into a stacked model, achieving the highest F1-score (84%) and demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal approaches.


### [Multiple PDF Reader using Gemini AI LLM API Key](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/Fraud-Detection-Using-KNN-Classifier)
- Developed a sophisticated PDF reader capable of extracting and interpreting data from multiple PDF documents simultaneously.
- Utilized the Gemini AI LLM API to enhance the system’s ability to read and understand complex textual data, including tables, with high accuracy.
- This project showcases the application of advanced AI technologies in document processing, enabling efficient data extraction and analysis from PDF files.

### [Fraud Detection Using KNN Classifier](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/Fraud-Detection-Using-KNN-Classifier)
- Participated in a hackathon that dealt with Detecting fraud for transactions in a payment gateway dataset.
- Executed KNN Classifier Model with an accuracy of 98%.
 
 ### [Face_Recognition_using_autoencoders](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/Face_Recognition_using_autoencoders)
- Dealt with dry bean data set, and performed SVM model with an accuracy of 85%.
- Developed an image recognition model for my batch profile using autoencoders.

 ### [News Recommendation using Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/Yugandhar0530-News_Recommendation_Reinforcement_Learning)
- Combined datasets from NDTV and India Today, creating a unified dataset.
- Utilized the BERT transformer model for tokenization and encoding of news article content.
- Employed Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) to cluster news articles based on their embeddings.
- Defined categories (General, Politics, Technology, Finance, Entertainment) and mapped clusters to categories.

### [News Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/News-Sentiment-Analysis_ML-DL-Models)
- Utilized a dataset spanning 8 months with about 100,000 news items on topics like economy, Microsoft, Obama, and Palestine.
- Explored models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and Word Embeddings.
- The BiLSTM model outperformed others with 72%, providing a robust solution for sentiment prediction in news headlines.
