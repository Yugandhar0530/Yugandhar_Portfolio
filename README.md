## Education
- Btech-Artificial Intelligence | Vijaybhoomi University (_2024_)	

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ Battrixx (_Apr2024 - Sep2024_)**
- Developed machine learning and deep learning models to predict battery performance.
- Developed a SOC and SOH forecasting model using ARIMA with an accuracy of 98%.
- Proficient use of Python and its data visualization techniques.
- Optimize production processes, leading to an efficient time and power consumption testing process.
- Implemented Python techniques to filter data, reducing processing time from 3 hours to 2 minutes.
- Which helped the simulation team to run simulations faster and get results faster.

- Dealt with dry bean data set, and performed SVM model with an accuracy of 85%.
- Developed an image recognition model for my batch profile using autoencoders.

 ### News Recommendation using Reinforcement Learning
 [Publication](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/Yugandhar0530-News_Recommendation_Reinforcement_Learning)
- Combined datasets from NDTV and India Today, creating a unified dataset.
- Utilized the BERT transformer model for tokenization and encoding of news article content.
- Employed Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) to cluster news articles based on their embeddings.
- Defined categories (General, Politics, Technology, Finance, Entertainment) and mapped clusters to categories.

### News Sentiment Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Yugandhar0530/News-Sentiment-Analysis_ML-DL-Models)
- Utilized a dataset spanning 8 months with about 100,000 news items on topics like economy, Microsoft, Obama, and Palestine.
- Explored models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and Word Embeddings.
- The BiLSTM model outperformed others with 72%, providing a robust solution for sentiment prediction in news headlines.
